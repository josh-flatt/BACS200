		<h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>

            The internet is a place that someone can find just about anything on, whether that means <br>
            information for businesses, making appointments, or some very dark interests. Alternatively, <br>
            the internet is also full of humor. Below are a few of my favorite web pages that I get a good <br>
            kick out of.

        <h2>Dad Jokes</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite kinds of jokes is <strong><em>Dad Jokes</em></strong>. These are the jokes <br>
            that are funny to the person who says them, or funny because of just how bad they are.
        </p>
        <p>One great place to find a bunch of these top-tier jokes and puns is on Twitter.</p>

        <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
        <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

        <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
        <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.  I have fond memories of this site listing out some of the best Chuck Norris facts, some of which have lived their way on to infamy.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
