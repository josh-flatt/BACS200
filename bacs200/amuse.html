		<h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>

            The internet is a place that someone can find just about anything on, whether that means <br>
            information for businesses, making appointments, or some very dark interests. Alternatively, <br>
            the internet is also full of humor. Below are a few of my favorite web pages that I get a good <br>
            kick out of.

        <h2>Dad Jokes</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite kinds of jokes is <strong><em>Dad Jokes</em></strong>. These are the jokes <br>
            that are funny to the person who says them, or funny because of just how bad they are.
        </p>
        <p>One great place to find a bunch of these top-tier jokes and puns is on Twitter.</p>

        <h2>Premature Celebrations</h2>
        <p>
            Something that is hilarious to watch is someone celebrating an accomplishment they're about to reach,<br>
            only to mess up their secured first place.<br>
            This is when someone in a race slows down to celebrate, only to be passed, or a wide receiver celebrating<br>
            a touchdown before scoring it, only to have the ball snatched out of their hands.<br>
            Below is a link to a subreddit full of these fails.

        <h2>Mirrors For Sale!!!</h2>
        <p>
            Something that I turn to whenever I'm not having the best of days is googling people selling mirrors. <br>
            Sometimes, the person selling the mirror can be seen wearing something absolutely hideous, but <br>
            the best of these photographs are when the people try to hide or mask themselves in the reflection.
