		Bill Gates is perhaps the most well-known Software developer of all time. Cofounding Microsoft, Gates quickly made a name for himself,
			while also becoming one of the wealthiest people alive. Bill is very-well loved by a majority of the world.

		<p><strong>Why he inspires me</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nobody to somebody - Bill Gates built a name for himself through hard work and perseverance</li>
			<li>Philanthropy - The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill and his wife have become loved by the communities that they 
				impact through their assistance in times of need. They are one of the top donors to the needy in the world.</li>
		</ul>
