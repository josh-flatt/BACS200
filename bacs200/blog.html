			<h1>Ukraine</h1>
			<p>An invasion perpetrated by the neighboring country Russia has brought Ukraine and the rest of the world into turmoil.</p>

				<h2>Social Implications</h2>
				<p>The invasion of Ukraine by by Russian and Belarusian troops has happened under the urge for Russia to beocome greater in area and become more powerful. Missile strikes and shelling has caused over one million civilians to flee, with many staying behind to fight the invaders to the teeth. Fathers, brothers, and sons have been forced to stay to fight to keep their homes from being destroyed by young russian troops, who, in fact, have hated every moment of fighting their neighbors in Ukraine. Civilians have also been killed, by bombings hitting places such as apartments, preschools, and health centers. </p>

				<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
				<p>The greatest economical impact to come about from the entire debacle has been the effective barring of nearly all trade with Russia. Sanctions, the modern version of a trade embargo or blockade, has blocked Russian banks from communicating with outside countries, and all exterior Russian assets being frozen. This has plunged Russia into an economic crisis, with their currency losing its value 30% in the very first days of the applied sanctions.</p>
				<p>There has also been a loss of transmissibility outside of currency/banks, with many companies pulling all interaction from Russia, including Oil and Gas companies, Airplane companies, tech companies, and the like. These sanctions are an effective use of non-lethal force, but do ultimately affect the citizens of Russia more than the oligarchs in support of the war, which arguably puts the hurt on the wrong people.</p>

			<section class="implication" id="imp-political">
				<h2>Political Implications</h2>
				<p>The political effects of the war have been worrisome. The russian invasion is the first of its kind since the Nazi Germany invasion of Poland that triggered the second World War. Another worrisome issue plauging the war is the notion that Russia is also invading Ukraine for a very similar and selfish reason that Germany did 83 years ago. Russia has invaded its neighbor for the main desire that its leader, Vladimir Putin, wants to rebuild the Russian Federation back into the size and power of its predecessor, the Soviet Union.</p>

			<section id="conclusion">
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In a highly publicized and pointless war, a selfish dictator has found himself willing to destroy anyone in his path to increase his strength. Throughout wars in history, there have been some sort of argumentative reasoning for either side. For example, the American revolution was a fight against tyrrany and to win independence as a soverign nation. The gulf war was fought as a "war on terrorism." Generally, when two countries fight, there are arguments to be made for both sides, but in this Russian invasion of Ukraine, there is no reasoning for Russia. Their only motivation is greed, and there is little to no argument to be made for their desires.</p>
